# App User Conversion Analysis

This project analyzes the conversion of free app users to paid users, both online and offline, using SQL and Python.

## Files in This Repository
- **my_query_1.sql**: SQL query used to calculate the online conversion of free users to paid users.
- **pyton_script.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook that combines the online conversion data with offline data using Python.

## Overview
The SQL query calculates online conversions from free to paid users. The Python script then merges this data with offline conversion data, providing a comprehensive view of user behavior.

## How to Use
1. Run the `my_query_1.sql` script on your SQL server to obtain the online conversion data.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `pyton_script.ipynb` and run it to combine the online and offline data.

## Results
The analysis provides insights into user behavior, highlighting the conversion rates from free to paid users in both online and offline modes.Category wise Month on Month analysis is available

**Note**: Information about users in online mode and offline mode stores in two different Databases which are not linked together, so i was not able to achive the above goal using only SQL query.Combination of SQL and Python helped me to achieve above goal successfully.
